querySelector("#value")
const btns=document.querySelectorAll(".btn")

querySelector will return the first element that contains the querySelector
querySelectorAll will return all the elements that have selector value like .btns


forEach is iterator for array it will take callback function and this 

callback function take three argument current element ,index, array 
current element is mandatory others are not 


btns.forEach(function(btn){
   btn.addEventListener("click",function(event){
        const whichbtn=event.currentTarget.classList;
        if(whichbtn.contains("decrease"))
        {
             count=count-1;
             value.textContent=count;   
        }
   }
}

here btn is one of the element of array  
btn.addEventListener we are applying the event listener that take callback function with event as argument 
it means we are passing all the properites of current event means click event

event have all properites ,we can differentiate each of btn   event.currentTarget.classList will give all the classes 
that event contains ,now we can check here particular class is present if yes we are doing some actions.
